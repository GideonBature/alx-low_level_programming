# Project Title: 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description

This project focuses on introducing the basic concepts of variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops in the C programming language. It provides a foundation for understanding control flow and variable manipulation in C.

## File Structure

The project's file structure is as follows:

.
├── 0-positive_or_negative.c
├── 1-last_digit.c
├── 2-print_alphabet.c
├── 3-print_alphabets.c
├── 4-print_alphabt.c
├── 5-print_numbers.c
├── 6-print_numberz.c
├── 7-print_tebahpla.c
├── 8-print_base16.c
├── 9-print_comb.c
├── 10-print_comb2.c
└── README.md

## Requirements

- All files must be written in C.
- The code must follow the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) style guide.
- The code must use the `putchar` function to print output.
- Each file contains a main function that outputs the desired result as specified in the task.

## Usage

To compile the C files, use the following format:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_filename>

For example, to compile `0-positive_or_negative.c`:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-positive_or_negative.c -o positive_or_negative

To run the compiled program, use the following format:

./<output_filename>

For example, to run the compiled `positive_or_negative` program:

./positive_or_negative

## List of Tasks

1. **0-positive_or_negative.c:** A program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
2. **1-last_digit.c:** A program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints the last digit of the number.
3. **2-print_alphabet.c:** A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.
4. **3-print_alphabets.c:** A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, using only the `putchar` function.
5. **4-print_alphabt.c:** A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters 'q' and 'e', using only the `putchar` function.
6. **5-print_numbers.c:** A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, using only the `putchar` function.
7. **6-print_numberz.c:** A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, without using any variable of type `char`.
8. **7-print_tebahpla.c:** A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using only the `putchar` function.
9. **8-print_base16.c:** A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using only the `putchar` function.
10. **9-print_comb.c:** A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using only the `putchar` function.
11. **10-print_comb2.c:** A program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99, separated by a comma and space, using only the `putchar` function.
