# ALX-Low_Level_Programming

Welcome to the ALX-Low_Level_Programming repository! This repository contains a collection of scripts and C programs that focus on various aspects of low-level programming.

## Preprocessor

The `preprocessor` directory contains a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name is provided through the `$CFILE` variable, and the output is saved in the file `c`.

## Compiler

The `compiler` directory includes a script that compiles a C file without linking. The C file name is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, and the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.o`. For example, if the C file is `main.c`, the output file will be `main.o`.

## Assembler

The `assembler` directory provides a script that generates the assembly code of a C program and saves it in an output file. The C file name is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, and the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.s`. For instance, if the C file is `main.c`, the output file will be `main.s`.

## Name

The `name` directory contains a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. The C file name is stored in the `$CFILE` variable.

## Hello, puts

The `hello_puts` directory includes a C program that prints the exact statement "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line. The program utilizes the `puts` function and returns the value 0.

## Hello, printf

The `hello_printf` directory provides a C program that prints the statement "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art" followed by a new line. The program uses the `printf` function, returns 0, and compiles without warnings with the `-Wall` gcc option.

## Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation

The `size_types` directory contains a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. The program produces the same output as the example, and it returns 0. Note that warnings are allowed in this program.

## Intel

The `intel` directory offers a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C program and saves it in an output file. The C file name is stored in the `$CFILE` variable, and the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.s`. For example, if the C file is `main.c`, the output file will be `main.s`.

## UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity

The `unix_genius` directory includes a C program that prints the statement "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error. This program does not use the functions listed in the `NAME` section of the man (3) `printf` or man (3) `puts`. It returns 1 and compiles without warnings when using the `-Wall` gcc option.

Feel free to explore the directories and engage with the provided scripts and C programs. Happy low-level programming!
