# 0x00-hello_world

Welcome to the **0x00-hello_world** directory of the ALX-Low_Level_Programming repository! This directory contains a collection of introductory programs and exercises aimed at getting you started with low-level programming.

## Introduction

In this directory, you will find a set of simple programs written in various low-level programming languages, such as Assembly, C, or any other language that focuses on programming at the hardware level. These programs serve as a foundation for understanding the fundamental concepts of low-level programming and the interactions between software and hardware.

## Contents

The **0x00-hello_world** directory includes the following files:

1. **hello.asm**: This file contains a basic assembly language program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It demonstrates how to work with registers, perform system calls, and manipulate memory at a low level.

2. **hello.c**: This file contains a C programming language equivalent of the "Hello, World!" program. It illustrates the minimal syntax and structure required to achieve the same output using a higher-level language that compiles to machine code.

3. **Makefile**: The Makefile in this directory provides a convenient way to compile the programs. It includes rules for assembling the assembly language program and compiling the C program.

## Getting Started

To run the programs in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have a low-level programming environment set up on your machine, including an assembler and a C compiler.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


3. Navigate to the **0x00-hello_world** directory:


4. Compile and run the programs using the provided Makefile:

- To compile the assembly language program, run:

  ```
  make hello_asm
  ```

  This command assembles the `hello.asm` file and produces an executable file called `hello_asm`.

- To compile the C program, run:

  ```
  make hello_c
  ```

  This command compiles the `hello.c` file and generates an executable named `hello_c`.

5. Execute the compiled programs:

- For the assembly language program, run:

  ```
  ./hello_asm
  ```

- For the C program, run:

  ```
  ./hello_c
  ```

You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the console.
